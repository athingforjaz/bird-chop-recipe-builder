# Welcome to Bird Chop Recipe Builder
Parrots can eat a lot of the same foods people do, and many bird owners like to give their birds a mix of fresh foods called "bird chop". This bird chop recipe builder will help you come up with tasty recipes your birds will love!

## To Do
- Add conditionals so that users can only select the correct number of ingredients
- Add a field to ask for total amount of chop desired, and calculate ingredients required to be purchased accordingly
- Consider: Moving to React?
- Add some example recipes (maybe additional pages? maybe on cards, as part of a carousel?)
- Nicer CSS styling :-) 

## To Done
- Copy over text
- Format in semantic HTML
- Add CSS styling (currently, it's functional!)
- Add radio buttons so that each item can be selected individually (actually, wound up using formatted divs)
- Add unique IDs for JavaScript selection
- Create a "your recipe" section that lists each item that the user has selected
- Make the recipe printable
